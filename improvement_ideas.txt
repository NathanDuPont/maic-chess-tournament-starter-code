A list of possible improvements. There is definitely more than what is on this list,
but these are just some good ideas for improvements

ideas to improve quality of decision making:
    - fiddle with piece weights
    - add piece positions to the weights
        - for instance, you want your knights in the center of the field instead of in the corners
    - add different heuristics for the different stages of the game
        - probably don't want to immediately want to start trading pieces
    - increase search depth
        - This will drastically slow down decision time. Look below for ways to potentially speed it up

ideas to improve search depth:
    - Multithread searching through the possibility trees (assuming this is allowed)
    - check out the MTD search algorithm instead of alpha beta to improve the search speed
        - this might be pretty difficult

ideas to improve the chess bot:
    - if you want to really go above and beyond, the best bots, such as alpha go by google, use 
    deep q neural networks. I have also seen other chess bots using the LSTM networks. However,
    chess has been known to be pretty difficult to implement this way. Good Luck!

Hints:
    - Mostly you will want to be fiddling with and adding new heuristics.
    - If you get to a point where your AI is just moving the same piece back and forth, then that
    means that your heuristics for that piece is too high.
    - Here are some chess tips, maybe you can make some heuristics out of them (https://thechessworld.com/articles/training-techniques/basic-chess-tips/)
